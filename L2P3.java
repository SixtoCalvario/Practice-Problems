/* 
Write a program that adds up all of the numbers that a user enters.  
Do not ask the user ahead of time how many numbers they want to enter.  
Instead, have them enter -999 to signal the end of their input.  
Be sure not to include the -999 in the total.  
At the end of the program, output the total of the number.  
Use a while loop.
