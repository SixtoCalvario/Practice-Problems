 Create a character array of size 35. 
 Allow the user to enter letters into the array as long as the letters are uppercase and 
 they donâ€™t exceed the available storage space of the array. 
 As soon as they enter a lowercase letter, the loop should terminate and 
 the program should output the physical and logical sizes of the array.
