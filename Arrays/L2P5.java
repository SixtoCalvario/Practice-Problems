/*
The Java String class has a method called split that takes a string parameter. 
This parameter is called a delimiter and is used to separate items of data. 
So, if a user enters a set of numbers in one line, separated by commas: 
1,3,5,2,4,6 and that data is stored in the string, input, the information can be separated into an array as follows:
 String[ ] arr = input.split(“,”);. Using this idea, take a list of integers from a user (of any length) separated by commas, store them in a String array, convert that array to an int array, and then find the average of the numbers.
