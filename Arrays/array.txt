Think of it like a carton of eggs 
Each egg is a piece of data
Each egg == an element of the array

The 3 commandments of Arrays :<
    1.Arrays can store ONE type of data at time.
    2. An array must be initialized with data or length. 
    3. Size of an array cannot be changed after it is created.


Unused Spots of an Array:
    Default value of an object is null
    Array is also an object btw gang

Setting value:
    names[2] = “rah rah ah ah ah”;

Printing Array:
    System.out.println(name[2]);

Finding the length of a Array:
    names.length; *THERE IS () BECAUSE ITS A PROPERTY YOU DONKEY!!!*
Length is a property of the array it is known and does not need to be calculated because you created it in the beginning 

System.out.println(name[0].length());

a refernece address is used to store where you can find the data of an objcet.
