/*
 Create an array of size 26 that stores the alphabet (in order). 
 Then, create a separate array that stores the alphabet in a random order. 
 At the top of the program, ask the user to enter a string. 
 Then ask if they want to encrypt or decrypt that string. 
 If they choose to encrypt, find the location of each letter in the original array
 and output (in its place) the letter at the same position in the unordered array. 
  Decrypting would involve working in the opposite direction.
