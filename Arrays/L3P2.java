 Write a program that acts as a personal phonebook. 
 Users can enter names and phone numbers, and determine the size of the arrays. 
 Names are stored in one array and the numbers in another. 
 Allow users to enter all of their information, then search for a name. 
 When the name is found, show the name and number on the screen. 
 If the name is not in the list, display an appropriate message.
