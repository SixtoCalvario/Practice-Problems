/*
    Write a program that asks a user for a password.  
    The password they enter has several rules as follows:
        The password must be at least 6 characters in length
        The password must have the number 1 in it
        The password must start with a capital P
    Write a method for each of the rules that outputs true if the password meets that criteria and false otherwise.  
    Valid passwords will output true three times.
