/*
 Write a program that creates a 1D array of integers.  
 The array should be of size 10 and should store random numbers between 1 and 50.  
 In the main, create and output the array.  
 Then, call a method named addFive that adds five to each value in the array.  
 DO NOT output the array values in the method.  
 However, in the main, after addFive is called, the main should output the values of the array again.  
 What happened?  Explain in a comment in the program.
