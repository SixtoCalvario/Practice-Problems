/*
 Write a program that takes 4 integers (x1, y1, x2, y2).  
 That information will be sent into several methods that output information about the points.  
 The following methods should be created:
    Format - outputs the points as (x1, y1) & (x2, y2)
    Midpoint - outputs the midpoint of the two points (look the formula up if you don’t know it)
    Distance - outputs the distance between the two points (look the formula up if you don’t know it)
    Slope - outputs the slope between the two points (look the formula up if you don’t know it)
